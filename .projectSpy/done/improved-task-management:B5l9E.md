Improved Task Management
===

Moving between tasks is a bit annoying in a scenario such as

```
Editing a task, realizing you need to review another task for something
- close current task (save or not)
- find and open other task
- find and open previous task
```

Being able to minimize a task, to navigate around and open another task at the same time could be handy.

An alternative which would be easier to implement than simultaneous dialogs is a previous task hotkey. Pressing ctrl-b to close the current task (if open) and open the previous task. This should still make the prompt for saving changes.

I went with ctrl-b to reopen the last closed task. I expect this to change but feels ok for now.
