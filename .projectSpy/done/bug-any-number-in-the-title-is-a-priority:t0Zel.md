bug: any number in the title is an order
===

this should be resolved to the specific syntax in help (1) (2)
additionally the number is being removed from the title when rendering (so that part is correct)
I think a solution is to find out where the regex is that finds the (1) and make sure it works correctly (always requiring the brackets).
