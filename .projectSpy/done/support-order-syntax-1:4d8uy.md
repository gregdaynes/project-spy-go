support order syntax (1)
===

How should this work?

1) modified date desc
2) Priority (number of !!!) desc

Maybe order is exactly that, the order - so if something is placed as 2 - it is the second task in the last (starting from 1)

If 2 tasks have the same, then order by priority, and then modified, then by random
