task id
===

Some sort of unique task id that can be used in part of the file name, as well as for reference in other documentation such as commit messages, or even something like slack. Give people an anchor to discuss.

something simple - maybe 5-6 characters of a hash on timestamp and title? or body of text at the time. It just needs to be random. I think something like a ulid is too much for this.

defining a route that could receive a task id to open it directly.
