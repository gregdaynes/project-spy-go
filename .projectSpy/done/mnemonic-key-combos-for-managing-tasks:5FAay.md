mnemonic key-combos for managing tasks
===

Previous/Next task
Delete/Archive task
Move task to lane X
jump to mode - hotkey to activate then show each task with a letter hotkey to jump to - like vim easy motion

This should likely be paired with the ability to highlight a task, instead of the view link when javascript is available
