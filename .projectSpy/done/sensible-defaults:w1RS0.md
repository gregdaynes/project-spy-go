Sensible defaults
===

Define a sensible default configuration, so that the .projectspy.json file is optional.

Default Lanes

- Inbox
- Backlog
- Blocked
- In Progress
- Done

The order should be defined as above

Only a lane with a backing directory should be present
That means if you have a backlog directory, then the lane should be visible. Maybe you only have an In progress lane, or inbox, in progress and done.
