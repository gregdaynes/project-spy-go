closing new task without saving
===

You should be able to restore the task create modal if accidentally clicked away, but the page did not reload.

The indicator needs to be clear and understandable
Not in the way, but very visible
Preferably work without JS, or as minimal as possible, while offering progressive enhancement

While I'm not opposed to this idea, the problem of being able to click away after editing a task is resolved. Clicking wash, pressing ctrl-w or escape, and clicking close will all prompt to be sure of close.

Something for the future may be to have multiple tasks open at the same time?
