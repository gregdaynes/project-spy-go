show task description
===

We'll need to take the markdown and turn it into html for rendering.
This will be a little weird, as we can't take the raw contents, rather just the body.

- [ ] Get text between header and changelog
- [ ] Pass body to markdown converter
- [ ] Set rendered markdown as task.DescriptionHtml
