Configuration Panel
===

A panel that has a form for creating and updating project spy configuration.

Being able to add/remove lanes without writing json would be nice. Toggling git mode and even renaming the app could be nice. 

When handling removing lanes, we should not allow removal of lanes with tasks. User must move tasks out manually, then remove the lane. Alternatively, they can do it in the FS and make their commit manually.
